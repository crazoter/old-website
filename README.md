Dump of my old website.
# Reflections
* Landing page
..* It seemed like a good idea at the time but in retrospect, a landing page that simply serves as a redirect page is wasteful / lacks purpose.
* About me page
..* I liked the contrast of the "About Me" against the black leathery background.
* Work page
..* The thing I liked (and wanted to retain) the most was the chatbox at the bottom right corner you often see in computer game interfaces; it was very fresh and unique in websites.
